## Overview
Welcome to the Fundamentals of Machine Learning project! In this project, we will embark on a journey to explore the core concepts and techniques that lay the groundwork for understanding machine learning algorithms and their applications.

### Overview: Univariate Distributions
Univariate distributions are fundamental to understanding probability theory and statistical analysis. In this section, we explore various univariate distributions, including the continuous uniform distribution and Gaussian distributions. Through coding activities, you'll learn how to create, analyze, and visualize these distributions using Python libraries like NumPy and SciPy.

### Codio Activity 2.2: Gaussian Distributions
Gaussian distributions, also known as normal distributions, are ubiquitous in probability theory and statistics. In this activity, we delve into Gaussian distributions, covering topics such as creating distribution objects, generating random samples, computing statistics, and plotting distributions and samples. Through hands-on coding exercises, you'll gain a deeper understanding of Gaussian distributions and their properties.

### Codio Activity 2.3: The Law of Large Numbers
The Law of Large Numbers is a fundamental concept in probability theory, stating that the average of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables approaches the expected value as the sample size grows. In this activity, we explore the Law of Large Numbers through experiments with uniform and Gaussian distributions. By analyzing sample means and distributions, you'll gain insights into the principles of probability and statistical inference.

### Overview: Multivariate Distributions
Multivariate distributions extend the concepts of univariate distributions to multiple variables. In this section, we cover measures of center and spread for multivariate datasets, including mean, median, quartiles, interquartile range, and standard deviation. Through coding activities, you'll learn how to compute and visualize these measures using Python libraries like NumPy and pandas.

### Pandas covariance correlations and introduction to Seaborn
In this section, we explore covariance, correlation, and their applications in data analysis using pandas and seaborn. Through coding activities, you'll learn how to compute sample covariance matrices, correlation matrices, and visualize them using heatmaps. Additionally, you'll gain insights into approximating correlation from scatterplots, enhancing your ability to analyze relationships between variables in multivariate datasets.

Embark on this exciting journey into the fundamentals of machine learning, and equip yourself with the knowledge and skills to tackle real-world data analysis challenges!
